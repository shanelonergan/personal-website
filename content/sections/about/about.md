Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Shane Lonergan. I am a man with many hats, my favorites being full stack web developer, actor, musician, and keyboard enthusiast. Born and raised in Michigan, I went to Oberlin College intending to become a doctor. However, in my first semester I was lucky enough to be cast in a student theater production of the musical Next to Normal, and my life would never be the same. Though I held on to my Biology major, a burning love of Musical Theater consumed my college years, and after graduating I moved to New York to pursue my Broadway dream. After a few years though, I found there was a hole in my life Biology had once filled. In search of something to replace it, I stumbled upon some coding tutorials on YouTube, and I was immediately hooked. I attended the Flatiron school, where I learned more in 15 weeks then I ever thought was possible, and met some of the most incredible people doing it. Since graduating, I have worked for almost 4 years as a Full Stack developer for the Church Pension Group while doing a bit of freelance on the side. Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
